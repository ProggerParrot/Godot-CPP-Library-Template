# Godot-CppProject-Template

Welcome to the Godot-CppProject-Template!

In the src-folder you can find some boilerplate code and a custom Player class. 
You can use it to export your own Godot Engine dll files with your gameplaycode in it!


Update: There is now Scons built, and vs-code support! 
        But you can also use only the Sourcecode and throw the other stuff away ;P


I Also uploaded two videos, where I show you how this thing works. :)
